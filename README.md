# Escaping Vanilla JS: Abstraction Challenge

## Project Overview

The Escape Vanilla JS Challenge is an interactive web-based project designed to test and enhance your understanding of Vanilla JavaScript, focusing on debugging skills, problem-solving, and the concept of abstraction. Participants will navigate through three themed "rooms," each presenting a unique challenge that requires them to debug and correct given JavaScript code to proceed. This adventure is themed around escaping the confines of Vanilla JavaScript to advance towards learning React.

## Getting Started 

1. Clone the provided Starter Code Repository to a local development environment (e.g., VSCode): https://github.com/CodeSpace-Academy/Module_10_StudentNo_Classcode_Group_Name-Surname_JSL10
2. Open the cloned project in a code editor.
3. Code a solution for each of the challenges as per the provided instructions.
4. Commit a changes to your local Git repository with meaningful commit messages.
5. Push a local Git repository to a GitHub account.
6. Verify that the changes have been successfully pushed to a GitHub repository.

## Debugging Tasks

1. **Correct the ID used in the event listener for Room 1.**
2. **Use the correct element ID when displaying results for Room 1.**
3. **Add the missing 'async' keyword to the JS concepts set.**
4. **Correct the function call to find the intersection of `jsConcepts` and `reactConcepts` for Room 2.**
5. **Ensure asynchronous operations are handled correctly in Room 3, particularly by adding `await` before the promise in `navigateLabyrinth`.**
6. **Adjust the `findMostRecentBook` function to correctly compare dates and find the most recent book.**
7. **Fix the `findIntersection` function to correctly determine the intersection of two sets.**
8. **Add the `await` keyword before `new Promise` in `navigateLabyrinth` to ensure the simulation of asynchronous operations works as intended.**

## Learning Outcomes

- Improved debugging skills in JavaScript.
- Enhanced understanding of asynchronous JavaScript, event handling, and working with sets.
- Greater familiarity with JavaScript's interaction with the DOM.
- Insight into the concept of abstraction in programming, demonstrated through the encapsulation of tasks and the separation of concerns in the challenge setup.
